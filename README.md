## Using Web Speech API
- Used web speech API to make the text-to-speech instead of '.wav' files.

button pressed via voice.

The audio files were made using Python(Google text-to-speech) and some off [this](https://medium.com/bucharestjs/how-to-build-your-first-app-with-electron-5ae2c2acb749) medium article.
