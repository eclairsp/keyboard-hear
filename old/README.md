This is a fun project I made to learn CSS. 
I made a CSS keyboard on screen and whenever you press the actual button on your keyboard, it highlights it on screen and tells you the 
button pressed via voice.

The audio files were made using Python(Google text-to-speech) and some off a medium article.

Will try to use the new HTML5 Web Speech API next
